Lab: Text Encryption using Transposition Cipher in Python
Objective

Develop an algorithm and implement a program to encrypt any text using a transposition method and perform decryption to recover the original message.

Input Data

Programming language: Python

Arbitrary text messages entered by the user in the variable sentence.

Algorithm Description

The message is stored in the variable sentence.

The message is split into groups of 6 characters.

Each character in the group is reordered according to a predefined key.

Encrypted groups are concatenated into a single string.

Decryption reverses the permutation using the inverse key.

Analysis of Results

The program successfully encrypts and decrypts any text message.

The transposition cipher works by permuting character positions, allowing exact recovery if the key is known.
